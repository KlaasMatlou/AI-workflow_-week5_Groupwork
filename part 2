PART 2: Case Study â€“ Hospital Readmission 
1. Problem Scope 
Problem: Predict patients likely to be readmitted within 30 days.

Objectives: Reduce readmissions, save costs, improve care.

Stakeholders: Doctors, IT department, Patients.

2. Data Strategy 
Data Sources:

Electronic Health Records (EHR)

Socioeconomic demographics

Ethical Concerns:

Patient privacy (data anonymization)

Data ownership and consent

Preprocessing Pipeline:

Remove duplicates/missing records

Feature engineering (e.g., time since last visit, comorbidities)

One-hot encoding for diagnosis types

3. Model Development
Model: Logistic Regression (easy to interpret in healthcare)

Confusion Matrix 
|            | Predicted Yes | Predicted No |
| ---------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| Actual Yes | 40            | 10           |
| Actual No  | 20            | 130          |


4. Deployment 
Steps:

Deploy via hospital cloud or EMR system.

Integrate prediction into doctor dashboard.

Compliance:

Follow HIPAA: encryption, access control, audit logs.

Optimization:

Use dropout regularization to reduce overfitting.
