# AI Development Workflow Project – Predicting Patient Readmission Risk

##  Project Overview

This project applies the **AI Development Workflow** to a real-world healthcare problem: predicting the likelihood of patient readmission within 30 days of hospital discharge. The solution is designed for use by hospitals to improve patient care, reduce costs, and allocate healthcare resources more effectively.

This repository includes:
- Problem definition and planning documentation
- Python code for data preprocessing, model development, evaluation
- Ethical reflection and workflow diagram
- Jupyter Notebook with reproducible analysis

## Problem Statement

**Objective*: Build a predictive model to identify patients at high risk of being readmitted within 30 days of hospital discharge.

**Stakeholders*:
- **Healthcare Providers*: Need insights to prevent avoidable readmissions.
- **Hospital Administrators*: Want to reduce operational costs and optimize patient flow.

**Key Performance Indicator (KPI)*: Achieve a minimum of 80% recall for positive (readmission) cases to ensure high-risk patients are not missed.

---

## Data Sources

1. **Electronic Health Records (EHRs)**: Patient history, diagnoses, procedures, medications.
2. **Demographics Data**: Age, gender, location, insurance type, socioeconomic status.

> ⚠Note: For demonstration, we use a public dataset from [Kaggle: Hospital Readmission Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).

## Data Preprocessing

Steps:
- Handle missing and inconsistent values
- Feature engineering (e.g., number of previous admissions)
- One-hot encoding for categorical variables
- Normalization of continuous variables
- Train-validation-test split (70-15-15)

---

## Model Development

**Chosen Model*: Logistic Regression (interpretable, fast, suitable for healthcare)

**Why Not Deep Learning?*
- Limited data availability
- Emphasis on interpretability over raw accuracy

**Hyperparameters Tuned*:
- `C`: Inverse regularization strength
- `solver`: Optimization algorithm used for model training

---

## Evaluation

**Metrics Used*:
- **Precision*: To minimize false alarms
- **Recall*: To identify actual readmissions
- **F1-Score*: To balance precision and recall

*Sample Confusion Matrix (Hypothetical)*:

|            | Predicted Yes | Predicted No |
|------------|----------------|--------------|
| Actual Yes | 40             | 10           |
| Actual No  | 20             | 130          |

- **Precision*: 0.67
- **Recall*: 0.80
- **F1-score*: 0.73

##  Deployment Plan

- Integrate model into the hospital’s Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system.
- Automatically flag high-risk patients at discharge.
- Alerts sent to case managers or care coordinators.
- Schedule monthly model retraining for concept drift handling.

## Critical Thinking

### Key Ethical & Bias Learnings:
-   **Biased training data** (e.g., from historical care disparities) can lead to the model falsely labeling certain demographic groups as "high risk" or missing actual risks in others, worsening health inequities and eroding trust.
-   **Mitigation Strategy**: Implement **fair representation in data** through active collection, augmentation, and **targeted re-weighting** during training to ensure the model learns to prevent readmission equally for all patients.

### Trade-offs (Interpretability vs. Accuracy & Resource Constraints):
-   **Interpretability vs. Accuracy**: Highly accurate "black box" models are hard for clinicians to trust and act upon. While simpler models are more interpretable, they may be less accurate. In healthcare, a **balance is crucial**, often achieved by using interpretable models or applying **Explainable AI (XAI)** techniques to complex models. Knowing *why* a patient is high-risk allows for targeted interventions.
-   **Impact of Limited Computational Resources**: Constraints necessitate choosing **simpler, "lighter" models** (like Logistic Regression) that are computationally efficient, require less complex preprocessing, and offer faster prediction times, crucial for real-time hospital environments

## Ethical Considerations

### Potential Bias:
- Historical data may reflect disparities in care across different races or income levels.
- Underrepresented populations may receive inaccurate predictions.

### Mitigation Strategy:
- Use tools like IBM AI Fairness 360.
- Reweigh datasets to balance representation.
- Evaluate fairness metrics during model testing.

## Reflection & Future Improvements

### Most Challenging Aspect:
-   The **Data Strategy** phase, especially **ethical concerns related to bias** and ensuring **data quality and integration**. Healthcare data is fragmented, often messy, and privacy-sensitive (HIPAA), making it hard to get clean, unbiased, real-time data for model training.

### Future Improvements with More Resources:
-   **Causal Inference & Advanced XAI**: Move beyond correlation to understand *why* risks exist, and provide interactive, explainable AI insights to clinicians.
-   **Richer & Diverse Data**: Integrate **Social Determinants of Health (SDOH)** and leverage **unstructured clinical notes** with advanced NLP for a more holistic patient view.
-   **Advanced Monitoring & Feedback Loops**: Implement automated MLOps pipelines for continuous learning, A/B testing of interventions, and direct clinician feedback to continuously refine the model.
-   **Dedicated Ethics & Oversight Committee**: Establish a multi-disciplinary committee to ensure ongoing ethical deployment and governance..
